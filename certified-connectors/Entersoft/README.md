## Entersoft Connector
Entersoft Connector unleashes the power of Entersoft Business Suite family products (either on-premise or on cloud) and makes them available in a well defined set of operations, objects and services that can be used in Logic Apps, Power Automate and Power Apps. Furthermore, Entersoft Connector exposes a set of business-level Trigger Events that can be used to initiate automated workflows.

Entersoft Connector relies on the [Entersoft Web API](https://api.entersoft.gr/help) to deliver an easy way to interact with the Entersoft Business Suite's business objects, datasets, automations, business rules, embedded workflows, operations, reports and services. You may use Entersoft Connector in almost any flow or application you are developing on the Microsoft Power Apps platorm, in Logic Apps and Power Automate exploiting the complete functionality of Entersoft Business Suite ERP, Entersoft CRM, Entersoft Warehouse Management, Entersoft Retail, Entersoft Enterprise Mobile Applications, Entersoft Proof Of Delivery, etc.

As events take place in the back-end of Entersoft Business Suite family products, these can trigger and initiate complex workflows on the Microsoft Power App platform, so you can achieve a high degree of automation, and integrate with any of the other systems and services that are present in the Power Apps connector community.
